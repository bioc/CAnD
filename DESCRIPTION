Description: Functions to perform the
        CAnD test on a set of ancestry proportions. For a particular
        ancestral subpopulation, a user will supply the estimated
        ancestry proportion for each sample, and each chromosome or
        chromosomal segment of interest. A p-value for each chromosome
        as well as an overall CAnD p-value will be returned for each
        test. Plotting functions are also available.
